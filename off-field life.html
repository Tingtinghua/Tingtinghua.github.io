                <p style="font-size:20px">At the age of five, Messi began to play for the local neighborhood junior football team, whose coach was his father.<br /><br />At the age of 11, Messi was diagnosed with a lack of growth hormone, or growth hormone, which would hinder his bone growth and prevent him from growing tall. The family's financial conditions can't afford the cost of little Messi's treatment. Messi's dwarfism is not incurable, but the injection of growth hormone costs as much as $900 per month. Newell's old friends of the parent team are not willing to pay for a child whose future is uncertain. The river bed team, who once coveted Messi, also gave up the idea of "poaching" after learning of his stubborn disease.</p>
